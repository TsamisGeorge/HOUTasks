# HOUTasks
All of my finished Tasks for Hellenic Open University(programming related).

This repository, as the title suggests, holds all of the assignments I was given at Hellenic Open University which have to do with programming.

Furthermore, every solution I offer is unique and shouldn't be seen as the best or the only one. It's also important to notice that the date these tasks are uploaded to GitHub is after the deadline for each task for the current year, as can be seen from the commit history.
